# Machine Learning algorithms "Mathematics"
In this repository I have tried to implement the "Mathematics" behind the Machine Learning "Algorithms" & tried to code it from scratch.





* Gradient Descent: 
    * Batch Gradient Descent: Number of rows = one update, slow, Convex data
    * Stochastic Gradient Desecnt: Number of rows = Number of updates, Fast, works for Non-Convex data
    * Mini-Batch Grafient Descent: Decide number of in a single batch.
* Logistic Regression
* Random Forest
* AdaBoost
* Gradient Boosting
* KNeighbour Classifier
* KMeans
